# Wild-Blueberry-Yield-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement  
The goal of this project is to **predict blueberry yield** using different environmental and pollination-related features such as fruit mass, seed count, rainfall, and bee visits.  
The target variable is **`yield`**, which is a continuous numeric value.

---

## ⚙️ Methods Used  
- **Data Cleaning & Analysis:** Checked for null values, duplicates, and analyzed correlations between features.  
- **Visualization:** Used a correlation heatmap to identify key factors affecting yield.  
- **Models Applied:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - R² Score  
  - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)

---

## 🧩 Conclusion / Results  
- Features like **fruit_mass**, **seeds**, and **fruit_set** had the strongest positive impact on yield.  
- **Linear Regression** performed the best among all models with:  
  - **R² = 0.99**  
  - **RMSE ≈ 133**  
- This shows that machine learning can **accurately predict blueberry yield** using environmental and pollination factors.
